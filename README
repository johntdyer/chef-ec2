Chef solo starter pack

In the instructions below replace $SERVER with the hostname of the instance,
which will be something like 'ec2-174-129-96-38.compute-1.amazonaws.com'.

1. Start an EC2 instance running Ubuntu (I used Jaunty 9.04 Server from http://alestic.com/)
   You'll need to edit .ssh/config on your local machine with the correct user
   and key for the server, e.g.:

   Host $SERVER
     IdentityFile /home/your_name/.ssh/your_private_key
     User root

2. Bootstrap chef:
   $ rake bootstrap SERVER=$SERVER

3. Edit your cookbook and dna.
   The dna for each server is held in dna/$SERVER.json

4. Update:
   $ rake update SERVER=$SERVER

5. GOTO 3
